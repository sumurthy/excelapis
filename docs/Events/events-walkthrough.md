# Events walkthrough
### Event triggers

Events within Excel can be triggered by:

- User interaction via the Excel user interface (UI)
- Office add-in (JavaScript) code 
- VBA add-in (macro) code 

Any change that complies with default behavior of Excel will trigger the corresponding event(s).

### Lifecycle of an event handler

An event handler is created when an add-in registers the event handler and is destroyed when the add-in unregisters the event handler or when the add-in is closed. Event handlers do not persist as part of the Excel file.

### Events and coauthoring

With coauthoring, multiple people can work together and edit the same Excel workbook simultaneously. For events that can be triggered by a coauthor, such as `onChanged`, the corresponding **Event** object will contain a **source** property that indicates whether the event was triggered locally by the current user (`event.source = Local`) or was triggered by the remote coauthor (`event.source = Remote`).

## Register an event handler

The following code sample registers an event handler for the `onDataChanged` event in the worksheet named **Sample**. The code specifies that when data changes in that worksheet, the `handleDataChange` function should run.

```js
Excel.run(function (context) {
    var worksheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getItem("Sample");
    worksheet.onChanged.add(handleDataChange);

    return context.sync()
        .then(function () {
            console.log("Event handler successfully registered for onDataChanged event in the worksheet.");
        });
}).catch(errorHandlerFunction);
```

## Handle an event

As shown in the previous example, when you register an event handler, you indicate the function that should run when the specified event occurs. You can design that function to perform whatever actions your scenario requires. The following code sample shows an event handler function that simply writes information about the event to the console. 

```js
function handleDataChange(event)
{ 
    return Excel.run(function(context){
        return context.sync()
            .then(function() {
                console.log("Change type of event: " + event.changeType);
                console.log("Address of event: " + event.address);
                console.log("Source of event: " + event.source);
            });
    }).catch(errorHandlerFunction);
}
```

## Remove an event handler

The following code sample registers an event handler for the `onSelectionChanged` event in the worksheet named **Sample** and defines the `handleSelectionChange` function that will run when the event occurs. It also defines the `remove()` function that can subsequently be called to remove that event handler.

```js
var eventResult;

Excel.run(function (context) {
    var worksheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getItem("Sample");
    eventResult = worksheet.onSelectionChanged.add(handleSelectionChange);

    return context.sync()
        .then(function () {
            console.log("Event handler successfully registered for onSelectionChanged event in the worksheet.");
        });
}).catch(errorHandlerFunction);

function handleSelectionChange(eventargs)
{ 
    return Excel.run(function(context){
        return context.sync()
            .then(function() {
                console.log("Address of current selection: " + event.address);
            });
    }).catch(errorHandlerFunction);
}

function remove() {
	return Excel.run(eventResult.context, function (context) {
		eventResult.remove();
		
		return context.sync()
			.then(function() {
				eventResult = null;
				console.log("Event handler successfully removed.");
			});
	}).catch(errorHandlerFunction);
}
```
