# Event API introduction

## Event API in Beta

Events APIs in Javascript provides a way of interacting between add-ins and users upon several objects. Each time certain types of changes occur in Excel, an event notification fires. By using the Excel JavaScript API, you can register event handlers that allow your add-in to automatically run a designated function when a specific event occurs. The following events are currently supported.

Please refer to [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js-docs/blob/ExcelJs_OpenSpec/Event_README.md) for the lists of all the arguments.
