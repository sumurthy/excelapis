Imagine you are developing an add-in as a simplified interface to author document properties for custom fields in SharePoint and a backend system that helps process them. After putting specific data into the custom fields via your add-in, a backend process then takes that document and performs some function. Here is what your add-ins does:
1.	Shows the user the document properties and allows them to edit specific items.
2.	Allows the user to change specific customer properties.
3.	Allows the user to Set those properties on a button click
